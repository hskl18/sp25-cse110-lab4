# Part 1: DevTools - Debugging

1. **What was the bug?**  
   The data type of the `num1` and `num2` is string, so the addition of them is sum of the two string.
2. **How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.**  
   To fix the bug, just need to use Number() to convert the string to number of num1 and num2.
